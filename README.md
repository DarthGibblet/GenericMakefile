# GenericMakefile
Generic Makefile that fits my typical project structure

Make file looks for any .cpp/.h files.
All intermediate build files are stored in "build" by default.
Dependency graphs are generated with the ".d" extension

Handy Commands:
  - Fork this repo into a new project: `git remote add upstream git@github:DarthGibblet/GenericProjectStructure.git`
  - Pull updates from base repo in forked repo: `git pull upstream master`
